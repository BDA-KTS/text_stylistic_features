The moon doesn’t answer, but it listens better than most. 
I left my thoughts in yesterday’s rain.
Some silences speak louder than storms.
The stars look different when you’re missing someone.
I write in the spaces between what I meant and what I said.
Not all goodbyes close a door — some open a window.
Even clocks pause between ticks.
The sky remembers what we forget.
I dream in colors I can’t name.
The sun sets slower when you’re waiting. 
Words fade, but the feeling stays.
You can’t unhear a truth whispered in love.
Nights like these hum in lowercase.
I carry quiet like a secret.
Somewhere, the wind still knows your name.
